# Smark App
Smart + parking = smark app 
## Introduction
I came up with idea to create a fake application, because I wanted to combine few technologies in one bigger project. Also I wanted to create an artificial work enviroment which was meant to be a surrogate of real work. Smark is an application which should help people to find parking spots in bigger cities much quicker. I am living in Cracow so I've included 6 biggest Cracow districits in project. Besides, the project includes a thorough analysis of the applications of the annual period.
